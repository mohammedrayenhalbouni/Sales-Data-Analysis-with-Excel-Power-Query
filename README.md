# Company Revenue & Sales Overview Dashboard

## Project Overview 🚀
This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow, from handling messy, unstructured data to developing an interactive dashboard with actionable insights. The goal was to transform raw sales data into a clean, reliable format and then visualize key business metrics to help stakeholders understand sales performance and make data-driven decisions.

## The Problem: Messy Data 🤯
The initial dataset was inconsistent and challenging to use for analysis. Key issues included:

- Inconsistent capitalization and invisible extra spaces in the 'Region' column (e.g., 'north', 'WEST', 'east') caused issues when filtering the data.
- Missing values (null) in critical fields like "Revenue" and "Discount".
- Non-standardized product entries, such as "phon" and "headfone," which would have resulted in inaccurate product-level analysis.

## Data Transformation & Cleaning ( Power Query ) 🧼

- Used the custom column feature to correct misspelled product names ("phon" => "phone") wich is neccessary for later analysis.
- Changed the "Region" column to a consistent format (e.g., all uppercase, no spaces) using fonctions like TRIM and UPPERCASE.
- I created a second query and filtered the data to include only products with unit price values, removing the other columns. I then refined it further to ensure each product appeared only once. After that, I merged this query with the first one (after deleting the unit price and revenue columns from the first), resulting in a third query that contained all sales with the correct unit prices. This made it easy to create a new 'Revenue' column by simply multiplying 'Unit Price' by 'Quantity'.

## Data Visualization & Insights 📊
The cleaned data was used to create a dynamic dashboard that provides a clear overview of the company's sales performance. The dashboard includes several key visualizations:

- **Revenue per Region**: A pie chart to quickly compare sales performance across different regions.
- **Best Selling Products**: A bar chart that identifies the top-performing products.
- **Monthly Revenue Trend**: A line chart that tracks sales over time, allowing for a quick analysis of seasonal or monthly trends.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Simple cards displaying "Total Revenue" and "Monthly Revenue Average" for quick, at-a-glance information.

The dashboard includes interactive slicers for Date, Product, and Region, allowing users to filter the data and explore specific insights.

## Tools & Technologies Used 🛠️
- **Microsoft Excel**: For the core workbook.
- **Power Query**: The primary tool used for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.
- **Power Pivot**: For building the data model and establishing relationships between tables.
